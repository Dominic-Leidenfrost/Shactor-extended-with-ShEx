## SHACTOR: Improving the Quality of Large-Scale Knowledge Graphs with Validating Shapes
### Demo Paper: SIGMOD-2023

> **â„¹ Note:** This repository is a fork of the [original SHACTOR demo repository](https://github.com/dkw-aau/demo-shactor). It was created and extended by **Dominic Leidenfrost** as part of a **Bachelor's thesis at TU Wien**.
> 
> **Extensions include:**
> -  **ShEx (Shape Expressions) functionality** - Added support for ShEx schema generation alongside SHACL
> -  **Docker image** - Pre-built Docker Hub image for easy deployment
> -  **Environment variable configuration** - Flexible configuration via environment variables
> -  **Various quality-of-life improvements** - Enhanced usability and documentation

This readme contains all the necessary configuration to run the demo:

## Documentation

- **[DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md)** - Complete Docker setup guide (recommended for quick start)
- **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)** - Manual setup instructions and detailed configuration

## Quick Start with Docker

**The easiest way to run SHACTOR is using our pre-built Docker image:**

```bash
docker pull dleidenfrost/shactor-app:latest

docker run -d \
  --name shactor \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -e SPARQL_ENDPOINT_URL=http://host.docker.internal:7200/ \
  -e SPARQL_REPOSITORY=LUBM-ScaleFactor-1 \
  dleidenfrost/shactor-app:latest
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

**For detailed Docker setup instructions, see [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md).**

---

## Running the application (Manual Setup)

**For detailed manual setup instructions, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).**

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to import Vaadin projects to different 
IDEs](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/step-by-step/importing) (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, and VS Code).

## Deploying to Production

To create a production build, call `mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Windows),
or `./mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Mac & Linux).
This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,
ready to be deployed. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using
`java -jar target/demoshactor-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Testing

### Running Tests

The project includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure code quality and functionality. You can run tests using Maven:

#### Run All Tests
```bash
# Windows
mvnw test

# Mac & Linux
./mvnw test
```

#### Run Specific Test Classes
```bash
# Run a specific test class
mvnw test -Dtest=DynamicUITerminologyTest

# Run tests in a specific package
mvnw test -Dtest="shactor.utils.formatters.*"
```

#### Run Tests with Coverage
```bash
mvnw clean test jacoco:report
```





## Project structure

- `MainLayout.java` in `src/main/java` contains the navigation setup (i.e., the
  side/top bar and the main menu). This setup uses
  [App Layout](https://vaadin.com/docs/components/app-layout).
- `views` package in `src/main/java` contains the server-side Java views of your application.
- `views` folder in `frontend/` contains the client-side JavaScript views of your application.
- `themes` folder in `frontend/` contains the custom CSS styles.
- `src/test/java` contains unit tests organized by package structure.
